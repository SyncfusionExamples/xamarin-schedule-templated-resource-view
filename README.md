# Resource-view
## Resource view in Xamarin Forms Scheduler
Xamarin.Forms resource view is a discrete view integrated with the scheduler to display events in all types of schedule views. It allows users to select single or multiple resources and display the events associated with the selected resources with efficient and effective utilization. Each resource can be assigned a unique color to more easily identify the resource associated with an appointment. Its rich feature set includes data binding, customization and other features like globalization and localization.
